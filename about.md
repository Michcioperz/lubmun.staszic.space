Model United Nations is an extraordinary possibility for the students to learn the functioning of the United Nations by simulating the committees' work. Each of the participants impersonates a chosen country's delegate, speaking and acting in the country's name, trying to reach its goals. Apart from educational benefits, the students also enjoy the contact with international community of alike, open-minded and critical thinkers.
