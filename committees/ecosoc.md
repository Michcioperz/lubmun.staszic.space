1. Tackling poor air quality and air pollution

   More than 80 per cent of the world’s urban population is exposed to air pollution levels higher than WHO guidelines, in EU it being more than 95 per cent as reported by the latest Global Environment Outlook assessment. This situation is reflected by increasing instances of health issues caused by air pollution as, according to the World Health Organization, each year seven million people are killed by air pollution. There is an urgent need for cooperation between countries all over the world in order to combat the transboundary pollution and introducing and improving the air quality laws and regulations. The matters of reducing the dependability of world’s population on fossil fuels as energy sources, as well as providing economical ways to improve air quality should be discussed in depth during the committee sessions.

2. Women’s Economic Empowerment

   Women’s work plays a vital role in supporting the growth of economies. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, greater gender equality in labour participation and education contributes to faster economic growth. Moreover, in certain African countries women have been essential to food production for many centuries. Even now women make up 43 per cent of agricultural workers in developing countries. During the last century there has been a lot of progress in the area of equal work and educational opportunities. For instance, the Global Gender Gap Report 2015 states that 20 per cent of world’s countries have closed their education gender gaps, and 39 per cent of countries have narrowed the gap down to 1 per cent. However, women’s economic empowerment in the world of work has not been fully reached yet. Women’s participation in labour markets is not equal to men’s. The problem of gender wage gap is still present as in many countries women earn 60 to 75 per cent of men’s wage. Females are more likely to labour in low-paid and undervalued jobs and still are majorly responsible for the housework. In the developing countries where women make a tremendous contribution to agriculture they constitute the minority of landholders.  How can these issues be solved?
