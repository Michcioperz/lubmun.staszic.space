1. South China sea conflict

   China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei have wrangled over the territory and sovereignity of South China Sea for centuries, but the tension has significantly increased over the past years. Within the last two decades the most serious clashes occured between China and Vietnam, as well as between China and Philippines. Although islands on the sea are uninhabited, they have vast amounts of natural resources, and the sea itself constitutes a major shipping route as well as home to fish which provide for the people in the region. The USA officially does not take sides in the confict, however its military ships and planes have been seen in the area of conflict. On 22 July 2011 the PRC, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam agreed to set guidelines which would help to cease the conflict, although the issue of natural resourcs remains unresolved.

2. CIA prisons and torturing in Europe
