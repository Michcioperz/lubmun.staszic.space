1. Increasing global number of child brides

   Santana comes from West Bengal in India and is a child bride. In her country 1 in 2 girls are married before their 18th birthday. “My parents married me off when I was 14. I am 18 now and have two children. I wanted to be a teacher but instead I was forced to get married.” Child marriage is a global problem present in different countries, cultures, religions and ethnicities. Child brides are found in every region in the world, from the Middle East to Latin America, South Asia to Europe. Provided that there is no reduction in child marriage, the number of child brides will reach 1.2 billion by 2050. Young girls  are often disempowered, dependent on their husbands and deprived of their fundamental rights to health, education and safety. The role of wives and mothers imposed on them increase the risk of dangerous complications in pregnancy and childbirth, infections with HIV/AIDS and domestic violence. Little access to education and regions which develop economically, they and their families are more likely to live in poverty. 

2. Social indifference to rape

   “Society has destroyed the lives of many sexually abused women with its attitude of blaming the victim,” says actor Manju Warrier in a short film on post-rape care for sexually abused women. One young women was being sexually abused at athletic club trip and another one raped at college. What happened to them is unfortunately not unique - Their lives fell apart and the men they accused suffer little or no consequences. High prevalence of drugs and alcohol in sexual assaults, the lack of training make women more vulnerable to sexual violence and for many serves as a way to justify it.
