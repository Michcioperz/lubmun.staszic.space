1. Ukrainian-Russian conflict 

   Russian-Ukrainian crisis began as a dispute over Ukraine’s trade agreement with the European Union and has turned into the bloodiest European conflict since the wars over former Yugoslavia in 1990s. The conflict started in February 2014 with the protests in Kiev caused by the Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to suspend negotiations with the European Union on the trade deal in the face of Russian opposition. A week later Russian military forces were sent to Crimea to allegedly protect its own citizens. The referendum was organized two weeks later, which caused The Ukrainian territory of Crimea being annexed by the Russian Federation on 18th of March 2014. The fights in the Eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian military and so-called pro-Russian separatists followed and were not stopped even though the ceasefire was set. It is estimated that since the beginning of the conflict 10,000 people lost their lives and more than 20,000 were injured. Despite the lack of media’s attention the conflict in the Eastern Ukraine continues and is still a pressing issue.

2. Biko Haram insurgency in Nigeria

   Boko Haram is an Islamic extremist group that is based in Nigeria, but also present in Chad, Niger and Cameroon. In 2015 it was ranked as the world’s deadliest terror group by the Global Terrorism Index. Boko Haram insurgency started in 2009, when the Boko Haram forces started an armed rebellion against the government of Nigeria. As a result more than 20,000 people has died and more than 2.3 million people were displaced from their homes. Boko Haram has maintained a steady rate of terrorist attacks since 2011, targeting politicians, religious leaders, civilians and security forces.  One of the most publicized attacks carried out by the Boko Haram was the kidnapping 276 schoolgirls in April 2014. Although in December 2015 Muhammadu Buhari, the President of Nigeria, claimed that Boko Haram was "technically defeated, the group still poses a serious security threat to the populations living in Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon and prevents international organizations from accessing some parts of these countries.
